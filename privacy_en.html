    <h1>Privacy and Cookie Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last update:</strong> 01/07/2025.</p>

    <p>Pursuant to Article 13 of EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), we provide the following information on the processing of personal data collected through the Venerdì House website.</p>

    <h2>1. Types of data collected</h2>
    <p>Data collected through the site may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification data (first name, last name)</li>
      <li>Contact data (email, phone)</li>
      <li>Data related to booking requests (stay dates, number of guests, any messages)</li>
      <li>Technical browsing data (e.g. IP address, user agent, access logs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purpose and legal basis of processing</h2>
    <p>Data collected are processed for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Management of availability and booking requests → legal basis: execution of pre-contractual or contractual measures</li>
      <li>Legal and fiscal obligations → legal basis: legal obligations</li>
      <li>Website security and prevention of abuse → legal basis: legitimate interest</li>
      <li>Possible sending of promotional communications → legal basis: consent</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Processing methods</h2>
    <p>Data are processed both on paper and digitally, in compliance with security measures required by applicable regulations.</p>

    <h2>4. Data recipients</h2>
    <p>Data may be shared with external parties (e.g. tax consultants, IT service providers) only if strictly necessary and always respecting the principle of data minimization.</p>

    <h2>5. Transfer to non-EU countries</h2>
    <p>Any transfers outside the EU will comply with the safeguards set out in Articles 44 et seq. of the GDPR.</p>

    <h2>6. Data retention period</h2>
    <p>Data will be stored for the time necessary to achieve the purposes indicated and, in any case, no longer than required by law.</p>

    <h2>7. Cookies and tracking tools</h2>
    <p>The site uses different types of cookies and similar tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical cookies</strong><br>Necessary for the website’s operation and to ensure security and access to main functions. They do not require user consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics cookies</strong><br>Collect aggregated and anonymous information on site usage (e.g. pages visited, time spent) to improve service quality. They are used only if you give your consent, where required.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party cookies</strong><br>May be installed by external services integrated into the website (e.g. maps, social buttons, anti-spam protection). The use of these cookies requires your prior consent, unless strictly technical. Specifically, the site integrates the interactive Google Maps map and the Google reCAPTCHA service. These services may install third-party cookies and collect browsing data, even when the user does not directly interact with them. <strong>The map is blocked for privacy reasons and only loads if the user clicks the “Accept the map” button. In this way, any cookies or browsing data are transmitted to Google Maps only after explicit consent.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.1 Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
    <p>To protect the site from abuse and automated traffic (bots), we use the <strong>Google reCAPTCHA</strong> service. Its operation involves collecting certain information (e.g. IP address, browsing data, user interactions on the site) which is transmitted to Google LLC, based in the United States. The use of reCAPTCHA is based on the Data Controller’s legitimate interest in ensuring the security of the website. For further information, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Third parties that may install cookies through this site include, for example:</p>

      <li>Facebook → <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read Facebook’s Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can give or refuse consent for non-technical cookies via the appropriate banner displayed when accessing the site. You can also manage your cookie preferences:</p>

    </ul>
